%% Introduction
% This File Exchange entry includes a package that is built on top of
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/index.html PDE Toolbox> for easy programmatic geometry
% creation, boundary condition (BC) and equation formulation and post-processing. The entry also
% includes several
% examples.
% 
% The package helps you:
%
% * Create boundary representation based geometries that can be used with <http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/index.html PDE Toolbox> functions.
% 
% * Represent boundary conditions and coefficients that can be used with <http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/index.html PDE Toolbox> functions
% 
% * Perform common query and post-processing functions on <http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/index.html PDE Toolbox> results.
% 
% For simple geometries, it will often be more efficient to use <http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/index.html PDE Toolbox> functions directly but
% for more complex geometries and formulations, using an abstract layer such as this package can be helpful.

%% Before you begin
% Unzip helperClasses.zip and cd to helperClasses. The examples listed below will run from this
% level.
